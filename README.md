# AuthTrail: Decision Management System™

**Version:** 1.0 (The "It Works on My Machine" Release)  
**Security Clearance:** Ultra-Violet

## 🧐 What is this?
AuthTrail is a state-of-the-art, terminal-based decision engine designed to streamline the approval of highly questionable municipal proposals. 

Do you need to approve a "Gravity Tax"? Do you need to reject a plan to "Paint the Moon Blue"? AuthTrail is here to log your choices with the cold, unfeeling precision of a 1980s mainframe.

## 🚀 Features
- **High-Speed Logging:** Writes text to a file faster than you can regret your decision.
- **Green Flag Technology:** The "Complete" button allows you to bypass critical thinking entirely.
- **Audit Trails:** Every decision is time-stamped, so when the "Inflatable Flamingo Chair" budget audit comes, you have proof it wasn't your fault.

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Download the folder.
2. Stare at it suspiciously.
3. Run the executable.

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. Read the **PROPOSED COMMAND** (Try not to laugh).
2. Read the **CONSTRAINT** (Realize the gravity of the situation).
3. Type one of the following:
   - `approve`: Let chaos reign.
   - `reject`: Be the fun police.
   - `complete`: Pretend you read the document and sign off anyway.

## 📂 Logs
All decisions are stored in `logs/authtrail.log`. 
*Warning: modifying the logs is a federal offense in several imaginary jurisdictions.*
